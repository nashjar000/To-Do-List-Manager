# Overview

For this project, my goal was to build a simple program using c++ within two weeks. I wanted to gain some experience coding in a language I haven't used yet. The main objective of this program is to allow users to create a to-do list that they could store in a .txt file. 

The software I used for this project was c++, which included variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and data structures. By using these features, I was able to make a program that was able to edit and modify text files. 

I had two purposes for writing this software. The first reason being to let users have a simple tool to organize a to-do list. The second reason was to deepen my understanding of the c++ language to gain more experience with coding.

Here's a link to a demo video of my program.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this project was VSCode and the C++ extensions. VSCode is a free programming app that can be used to write in many different programming languages. The C++ extensions were needed so that I could write code in that language. I was able to find those extensions directly through VSCode on the side panel. Alternatively, there is a website that anyone can visit to download the programming language as well.

To run the program, run the following in the terminal:
g++ -o todo todo.cpp
./text_editor

The main programming language used in this project is C++. C++ shares similarities with languages like C, C#, and Java and offers support for classes and objects.

# Future Work

- Include do-dates for tasks to be completed by
- Allow users to use other text files instead of ".txt".
- Include a GUI
